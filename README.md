the pursporse of this code is to create an IoT device intended for employee attendance control, but also adaptable for various purposes, such as RFID-based access control systems, monitoring systems, or other IoT applications depending on its coding (haha). This device is capable of reading RFID cards (of course haha) using the RC522 module and displaying relevant information on the 16x2 LCD screen using an I2C connection.
